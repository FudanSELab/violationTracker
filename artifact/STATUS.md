We are applying for **Available** and **Reusable** badges.

### Reason for Available badge

Our artifact is permanently available via Zenodo. All required components of our tool are packed and ready for download and local installation. 

### Reason for Reusable badge

Our artifact is carefully packed in Docker images containing all supporting environment and provided with step-by-step installation and running instructions. It is a fully funtional tool. Researchers and practitioners are able to use our the tool to replicate the violation matching and tracking functionalities, with our accompanied small example and also with their own projects to be tested. 

Although it is not feasible to replicate all results reported in the paper *ViolationTracker: Building Precise Histories for Static Analysis Violations* (icse23main-p2422) within only 30 minutes, one may install and run the accompanied example with no difficulties. One may also use our tool to replicate all results by configuring SonarQube, MySQL Server, Mongo DB Server and other environment on his/her own computer (physical PC or Workstation or Server). Our GitHub repository is located at [FudanSELab/violationTracker (github.com)](https://github.com/FudanSELab/violationTracker) for further references.
